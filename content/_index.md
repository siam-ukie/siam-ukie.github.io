## About the SIAM UKIE Section

The SIAM UKIE Section was formed in 1996 by the [Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM)](https://www.siam.org/) with the aim to promote and support applied and industrial mathematics in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland.

### Membership

Membership of the Section is free and automatic for all SIAM members whose residence or principal place of work or study is the UK or Republic of Ireland.

The full rules of procedure for this Section can be downloaded [here](https://www.siam.org/media/lowli0cc/rop_siamukie.pdf).

### Distribution list

Members can send/receive posts to/from other members using the Section Community on [SIAM Engage](https://engage.siam.org/communities/mycommunities), which operates much like a mailing list. Check your SIAM Engage Notification Settings to parametrise how and how often you would like to receive announcements via Email. If you have any questions regarding SIAM Engage, please contact [{{<param thesecretary>}}](mailto:{{<param thesecretary_email>}}), the current Secretary/Treasurer of the SIAM UKIE Section.

Until January 2022, announcements were made using a [Wordpress blog](https://siamukie.wordpress.com/), now archived and no longer active.

### Activities

SIAM's acronym also stands for Science and Industry Advance with Mathematics. The activities of the Section are consistent with this objective and include the organization of annual meetings, student chapter events, and support for other initiatives and events that bring together SIAM members from different fields.
