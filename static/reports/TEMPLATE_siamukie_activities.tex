(SIAM) with the scope to promote and support applied and industrial mathematics in the UK and
the Republic of Ireland.

\subsection*{Fellows}

This year, SIAM UKIE member Prof. Jennifer A. Scott (University of Reading) was elected SIAM Fellow.


\section*{Students}

There are currently 17 SIAM UKIE Student Chapters at the following universities: 
University of Bath (England), 
University of Cambridge (England), 
Cardiff University (Wales), 
Dublin area (Ireland), 
Heriot-Watt/Edinburgh Universities (Scotland), 
Imperial College London (England), 
National University of Ireland Galway (Ireland), 
University of Limerick (Ireland), 
University of Liverpool (England), 
University of Manchester (England), 
University of Nottingham (England), 
University of Oxford (England), 
University of Reading (England), 
University of Sheffield (England), 
University of Southampton (England), 
University of Strathclyde (Scotland), 
University of Warwick (England), 
The new Student Chapter at the University of Sheffield has been founded in 2021 and held its
inaugural conference in June 2021.

All SIAM UKIE Student Chapters are very active, organizing their own local events and activities. 
Activity reports are available at \url{https://outreach.mathstat.strath.ac.uk/siamukie/chapters_activity.html} 
or on the Chapter's websites (see \url{https://outreach.mathstat.strath.ac.uk/siamukie/chapters.html}).

In addition to these activities, one of the chapters hosts an annual SIAM National Student Chapter
Conference (SNSCC) since 2012. These conferences allow students to interact across universities. The
9th SNSCC was organized by the Student Chapter at the University of Oxford. The event, which was meant to take 
place in the Summer of 2020 but had to be postponed due to the covid-19 pandemic, took place virtually 
on 14-15 June 2021. 
The generous support of SIAM significant covered Zoom and Gather Town expenses and Student talks and poster prizes. 

% Several Student Chapter representatives from the UK were invited by the SIAM Education Committee
% to present their work at the SIAM Annual Meeting (AN21), which was held virtually in July 2021.
% One of the participating students wrote about his experience: 

Members of five UKIE Student Chapters received SIAM Certificates of Recognition 2021. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Alvaro Torras Casas, Cardiff University Student Chapter
\item Edward Donlon, Dublin Area Student Chapter 
\item Kleber Oliveira, University of Limerick Student Chapter 
\item Michael Connolly, University of Manchester Student Chapter 
\item Hannah-May D'Ambrosio, University of Strathclyde Student Chapter
\end{itemize}
Their names were publicized on the SIAM UKIE digest in June 2021.



\section*{Website, blog and social media activities}
Since April 2020, the SIAM UKIE Section website has moved to  
\url{https://outreach.mathstat.strath.ac.uk/siamukie/}, including the WordPress blog \url{https://siamukie.wordpress.com} which by now is an established outlet for our Section members to publish their own posts, including the possibility to upload photos, videos, and other multimedia content as appropriate. Each post is under editorial review and edited before publication. Also, since 2016, the Section has had its own Twitter account \url{http://twitter.com/SIAM_UKIE}. This account currently has 410 followers (up from 324 last year) and is mainly used to draw attention to new blog posts and for retweeting UKIE relevant news.

\section*{Digest}
The SIAM UKIE Section continues to send monthly digest to all its members compiled from members submissions and 
other relevant items found by the officers. 
These newsletters successfully serve the purpose of “staying in touch” with our
members and to further facilitate the dissemination of information among members from different
areas in the UK and the Republic of Ireland.
The monthly digest has been particularly well received from students and early career members of the community. 

\section*{Annual Sectional Meeting}
The 21st Anniversary Meeting of the UK and Republic of Ireland Section of SIAM was held virtually on 
January 8, 2021. 
The local organizers were the Section's Officers (Prof. F. Tisseur, Prof. S. Mitchell, and Dr. F. Arrigo). 
The event featured one high-profile keynote by Prof. James Gleeson (University of Limerick) entitled 
{\it ``Branching processes as models of cascade dynamics on networks"} and was followed by the Section's Business Meeting. 
A total of 47 members attended the virtual meeting. Details can be found \href{here}{https://siamukie.wordpress.com/2020/12/18/siam-ukie-annual-e-meeting-2021-registration-open/}
